##Weather Menu Application
This is a project where I'm pretty much just messing around with electon.js to build a desktop application that interacts with a weather api to display the weather in the menu bar

##Todo
1. Add custom location functionality
2. Add color customization functionality (maybe)
3. Fix issues detailed for project
4. Package for consumer usage
